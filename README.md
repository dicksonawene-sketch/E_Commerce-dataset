# 📊 E-Commerce Data Analytics Project (SQL)

## Introduction
This project is a **practical application of SQL-based data analytics** on an e-commerce dataset.  
The goal was to **push my limits** and practicalize everything I had learned from tutorials and guided exercises.  

I deliberately chose complex queries that required:
- Multiple joins across messy tables  
- Time-based and cohort analysis  
- Handling NULLs and missing keys  
- Iterative cleaning and validation  

This project was about **learning through solving difficult problems** — not just executing queries.

---

## Background
E-commerce datasets are often **inconsistent and messy**. In this dataset, some challenges included:

- Orders recorded in different districts and formats  
- Product category names not standardized  
- Missing or NULL reference keys  
- Duplicate or misaligned records across tables  

These inconsistencies required me to **clean, adapt, and validate** all data before meaningful analysis could occur.  
I treated this as part of the learning process — intentionally “claiming” hard problems to maximize growth.

## Tools I Used
- **PostgreSQL** – query execution and analysis  
- **SQL (CTEs, JOINs, CASE, EXISTS, LAG, ROUND, DATE_TRUNC)**  
- **VS Code** – query development and debugging  
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and documentation

## The Analysis

### Query 1 – Customer Purchase Overview
**Goal:** Establish how customers and orders relate  
**Why:** Correct joins are the foundation for all later analysis

### Query 2 – Revenue Aggregation
**Goal:** Compute total and average revenue  
**Why:** Provides financial baseline for trend analysis

### Query 3 – Monthly Revenue Trends
**Goal:** Track revenue over time  
**Why:** Detect growth, decline, and seasonality

### Query 4 – Product Category Performance
**Goal:** Compare revenue across categories  
**Why:** Identify top-performing and underperforming categories

### Query 5 – Category A vs Category B Customers
**Goal:** Identify customers who bought Category A but not Category B  
**Why:** Demonstrates targeted segmentation and anti-join logic

### Query 6 – Repeat Purchase & Retention
**Goal:** Track repeat purchases over time  
**Why:** Measures customer retention and long-term value

### Query 7 – Potential Revenue Analysis
**Goal:** Estimate unrealized revenue opportunities  
**Why:** Provides insights for business growth and cross-selling

### Query 8 – Delivery Performance
**Goal:** Classify orders as Early, On-Time, or Late  
**Why:** Links logistics performance to customer experience

### Query 9 – Delivery Status Distribution
**Goal:** Measure frequency of each delivery outcome  
**Why:** Highlights operational risks

### Query 10 – Integrated Business Summary
**Goal:** Combine insights across revenue, customers, and delivery  
**Why:** Produces a clear, business-ready overview

## What I Learned
Through this project, I developed:

- Strong **SQL query design skills** (JOINs, EXISTS, CASE, LAG, ROUND)  
- Ability to **handle messy, real-world data**  
- Iterative **debugging and correction techniques**  
- Cohort analysis and time-based aggregation thinking  
- Analytical reasoning: validating results rather than assuming correctness  

I also learned that **intentional practice with challenging problems** accelerates learning more than easy, guided exercises.

## Conclusions
This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Take on **complex data challenges** intentionally  
- Write **robust, readable, and validated SQL queries**  
- Analyze data for **actionable insights**  
- Learn from mistakes and iterate for correctness  

It reflects both **technical skills** and **analytical thinking**, showing that I can not only write SQL but also **apply it thoughtfully to solve real business problems**.
